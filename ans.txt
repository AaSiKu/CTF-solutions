Alalyzed first by trial and error , found the first 3 operations in the function are reversible without any modifications, for the 4th function (ie. shifting bits by 16 pos, or operation is performed first by shifting all the bits to the right by 16 and left by 16 and taking the or operation, for this to be reversible I found that the original number should atmax be 36 bits and the output would be 48 bits, indeed the output key you gave was 48 bits , so the ans is of the form First 16 bits +last 16 bits+First 16 bits, so we can obtain the origninal number simply by dividing by 2**16.
